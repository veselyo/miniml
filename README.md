# MiniML

## Description

This project is an interpreter for MiniML. MiniML is a compact, OCaml-like functional
programming language. The primary goal is to demonstrate how programming languages
execute code by implementing three different evaluation strategies: the substitution
model, dynamic scoping with environments, and lexical scoping with environments.

## Features

*   **Evaluation Semantics Implementation:**
    *   **Substitution Model (`eval_s`):** Names are directly replaced by
        their values.
    *   **Dynamically-Scoped Environment Model (`eval_d`):** Variables are
        resolved based on the runtime call stack.
    *   **Lexically-Scoped Environment Model (`eval_l`):** Variables are
        resolved based on the textual structure of the code, implemented
        using **closures**. This is the standard in most modern languages.
*   **Interactive REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop):**
    Allows users to type MiniML expressions and see immediate results.
*   **Simultaneous Semantics Comparison:** The REPL uniquely displays the
    output of an expression as evaluated by all three semantics side-by-side,
    offering a clear and immediate comparison.
*   **Core Functional Language Constructs:** Supports integers, booleans,
    arithmetic and comparison operators, conditionals, first-class functions,
    `let` bindings, and recursive functions (`let rec`).
*   **Informative Error Handling:** Provides clear diagnostics for common
    issues like syntax errors, type mismatches, or unbound variables.
*   **Well-Tested Implementation:** Includes a comprehensive suite of unit
    tests ([tests.ml](tests.ml)) to verify the correctness of evaluators and
    language features.
